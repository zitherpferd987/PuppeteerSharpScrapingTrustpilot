# Trustpilot Review Scraper (C# + PuppeteerSharp)

This is a console application built with C# and [PuppeteerSharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp) that automatically scrapes reviews from a specific Trustpilot page. It extracts the top 10 reviews, parses them into structured data, and injects them into an HTML template for display.
